Ethereum,Ethereum falls to 4-year low against Bitcoin as BTC breaks above $94k,,2753,https://cryptoslate.com/insights/ethereum-falls-to-4-year-low-against-bitcoin-as-btc-breaks-above-94k/,1732112845.0
Ethereum,Realised today that I don't like where Ethereum is going,"Background :

I only hold BTC and ETH (70%/30%).  
I've been around in the crypto space for a very long time.  
The following is my own opinion and this a this a friendly discussion about ETH only. I'm not looking for alternatives, I already know most of them.

Lately, I've been really considering swaping my ETH for BTC (at least for now) for the following reasons:

* Ethereum team pretty much completely gave up on scaling the main chain. they are now solely focused on improving L2s and pushing people toward using them.
* I think L2 suck, and that they're not user friendly. some people might argue that bridging tokens is ""easy"", but I think you're missing other important points : 1- whenever i want to get paid in ETH from a business or someone, NO ONE EVER has a withdraw/payment with L2s. same goes with sending money to normal people. 2- This is pretty much how L2 feels to for anyone I've ever talked to : Risky / Complicated / afraid coins will be lost (multiple chains and names confusing) / afraid to use a malicious site / Fuck this, I rather just use another cheap L1 chain.
* This is how I see BTC/ETH : -I hold BTC because i believe it's the best store of value (like gold) -I hold ETH because i believe it's a cheaper way to move money, while also being safe store of value that's not gonna dump and die in the future. The thing is now, I'm starting to believe that Ethereum lost the position as a cheap L1 chain and it's never getting it back because they don't care about cheap L1 anymore. (like how Vitalik's gas limit proposition got ignored and sharding on L1 not being a priority anymore). Your bags aside, how can you possibly think that most people will be using L2s in the future, when you can clearly see that people are having a hard time just wrapping their head around basic crypto stuff ? I just can't see it.

**UPDATE** : Thank you all for your answers and ideas. I came now to realization that it is unreasonable to expect ETH to achieve low fees on L1, while at the same time keeping the same level of decentralization and security. I still believe L2 as it stands is not user friendly enough. and thanks to u/kumomax1911 comment, I know now that there is ongoing work to make L2 more seamless experience without the need for bridging (still need to search more about it) . I think that would be a good compromise to the current situation. only time will tell.",758,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1bhsisr/realised_today_that_i_dont_like_where_ethereum_is/,1710773281.0

Ethereum,Ethereum sell targets,"For those who are holding ETH, what is your bull exit plan?

Initially, my target was for 170,000$ BTC and with a 0.07 ratio about $12,000 ETH.

Recently, performance of ETH has been disappointing relative to bitcoin.

Historically it gains against btc during the Q1 post halving year, but historically it also performs much better on a halving year than it has this year, and historically it performs  much worse in a bear market than it did last bear market!

So there’s not really anything reliable to go off as the market is still evolving, and the Q1 pump on ETHBTC could very likely not come to fruition.

Based on this, I’ve set a ‘safe’ target of around 7k (0.04 ETHBTC with 170k BTC) with a bullish target of ~10k (~0.06 ETHBTC).

Obviously, I am fairly confident btc gets a 70% pump from here which will affect everything.

In fact this means ETH has wiped all out gains against BTC since April 2021 when ETH was \~2k and BTC was around \~$60k. Since then ETH has completed the merge moving it from POW to POS and Proto-Danksharding (which dropped the gas cost on L2s). Still in comparing it's value against BTC, ETH has officially lost all of it's bear market gains.

Ethereum,Ethereum Classic and Bitcoin Cash are pumping...which means the latest batch of noob retail investors have finally arrived!,"I think many of you would consider Ethereum Classic a terrible investment, considering (1) it was the result of a hack, and (2) the hacker still has their bags of ETC available, which they periodically dump on unsuspecting investors. Bitcoin Cash doesn't have such a problematic origin, but might also be considered an unwise purchase given the lack of usage and development compared to BTC and other good projects.

So, when I open the charts and see that specifically BCH and ETC have been pumping hard for the last couple of days, my only conclusion is that new retail investment money has arrived and these noobs are dropping cash on 'cheaper' projects with the name Bitcoin and Ethereum in it. I should know, I did this exact thing myself earlier this year!

Here's hoping this signals the start of a another massive pump too.

If these networks had the Ethereum levels of activitynon them, they wouldnt hold for long. Cardano has a handful of dapps and its already clogged? Same with Polygon. 1 dapp putting whole network on stop is really not what people would expect of the so called ""next gen eth competitors.""

While I 100% agree that gas fees on Ethereum are absurd, I wonder if the alternatives that we have at the moment in top10 are going to solve that.

Ethereum,The Ethereum triple halving and why ETH will easily overtake BTC in marketcap,"&#x200B;

So, why do I make such a confident claim as to why Ethereum will easily surpass BTC as the largest cryptocurrency by almost every metric including market cap? Simply put, its because the Ethereum selling pressure is going to reduce by as much as 90% – the equivalent of three Bitcoin halvenings in the span of 12 months. ETH will experience what is known as a triple halving, yes you read that right, a triple halving. To understand the triple halving of ETH we need to first understand what the BTC halving is:

* A Bitcoin halving event is when the reward for mining bitcoin transactions is cut in half.
* This event also cuts in half Bitcoin's inflation rate and the rate at which new bitcoins enter circulation.
* It is widely thought that all previous halvenings are closely correlated to the initiation of bull market cycles leading to much higher prices than previous cycles.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ya4ccg2yuqh71.png?width=1070&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb05471edf3ba58045ef2534d2b377c4f5413c91

Ethereum will undergo a triple halving, or in other words, 50% \* 50% \* 50% = 12.5%, i.e. a 87.5% reduction in issuance which is the equivalent to 3 consecutive Bitcoin halving events. The upcoming Triple Halving will likely lead to a price explosion that I believe will allow ETH to easily overtake BTC in market cap. In this post I will discuss \*\*two\*\* key events that lead to the triple halving and why ETH will then easily overtake BTC as the most dominant crypto currency.

* The first event, and likely the least impactful of the two events will be caused by EIP-1559. On August 5th, EIP-1559 was passed, which means that 70% of the transaction fees in Ethereum will continually be burned. The more the network is used, the more fees will be burned. It is expected that with the deployment of EIP-1559, Ethereum would become net deflationary and stand at 2% negative annual issuance. In just one week over $100M of ETH was burned, this is insane. The drop in sell pressure represents a 30% reduction with the release of EIP-1559 which represent just over half of one BTC halving

https://preview.redd.it/cneo5zbzuqh71.png?width=853&format=png&auto=webp&s=636dc44bcedbadf71323f6e2ba73c5e23ced28f1

* The second (and very significant) cause would be the transition to Proof of Stake (POS) from Proof of Work (POW). To understand what this means we firstly need to understand Ethereum mining. As it stands, approximately 12,800 ETH (equivalent to $39,000,000) is rewarded to miners for running the Ethereum network and keeping it secure every day. Since ETH is still in a Proof of Work system most of this ETH is immediately dumped and sold into the market. Since the miners run a cash business, they need cash for electricity, equipment, paying investors etc. So everyday there is \*\*at least\*\* $39,000,000 worth of selling pressure for ETH each and every day. The implications for this transition means that ETH will go from a mine and dump economy (POW) to a stake and restake economy (POS). POS encourages saving as the more ETH you have the bigger your monetary benefit; this will not be for true all people as of course people will still sell a lot of ETH but most people will hold and restake their rewards as time goes by, enormously reducing sell pressure.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2y8ue7j0vqh71.png?width=885&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5767436475c53af3d23266a2edb01c4cfde5998

So now you know what the ETH triple halving will lead to ETH being deflationary and have a \~90% reduction in sell pressure, we will discuss why ETH will overtake BTC in market dominance. Firstly, price leads narrative. A narrative by itself potentially creates a price increase. A narrative with a significant price increase validates the narrative and induces a price explosion. The following events will convince any investor that ETH is ultra sound money:

1. Exploding active accounts and transaction volume
2. Low fees - The most significant problem with Ethereum is scalability and is about to be solved, once and for all. The Layer 2 deployment is in full swing and the transaction fees will come down in the future
3. Powerful DeFi & staking yields
4. An environmentally-friendly Ethereum 2.0. ETH 2.0 will require 99% less energy to run and this is required to break into mainstream adoption. This is an obstacle where BTC failed. BTC is currently using up 0.7% of the world’s electricity while only serving 50 million people and you would likely need to use 70% to serve 5B (Full global adoption). Climate protection is the number one agenda in many developed countries and simply for this reason is why BTC will never truly be able to become mainstream

Another likely scenario is sooner rather than later Elon Musk will ride the ETH bandwagon, the news of Elon Musk praising Ethereum’s soon upcoming launch of energy-friendly Ethereum 2.0 POS will be enough to propel ETH to 5 digits alone whether this is a good or bad thing is another debate in of itself.

&#x200B;

Now, we must also take into account that all this will be happening when there is record demand for access to the Ethereum blockchain for DeFi and NFT's. ETH is simply too important relative to BTC. Ethereum has flipped Bitcoin in every important metric, the last remaining metric is the market cap and that is only one 2.5x of Ethereum away.

But now you may ask, isn't this narrative already priced in? Well no, I don't believe so. The Triple Halving narrative only came into existence on April 27th (A 79 page investment report on why ETH could hit $150,000 by 2023 can be found on this link [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bECqgijhgjdS782AB620gFjK5qx-vA99/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bECqgijhgjdS782AB620gFjK5qx-vA99/view?usp=sharing) ) how many of you had even heard of the ETH triple halving before reading this post? The average person will have no clue what even an Ethereum is but almost everyone has heard of BTC. In the last cycle the world discovered BTC not ETH, this cycle the world will discover ETH. BTC's first mover advantage will only take it so far and over time will begin to mean less and less. The shifting narrative of BTC to ETH will come as a result of BTC failing to be environmentally friendly and BTC will always fail at this hurdle as well as the very limited utility of BTC. Another reason why its unlikely this has been priced in yet is the Bitcoin halving was never priced in even though people knew about it 4 years in advance and it always led to a 100x price increase.

Now we must also discuss some major reasons why this laid out foundation for the price of ETH to explode could be hindered. The journey for ETH will not be straight forward by any means and will likely be plagued by delays and many other unforeseen events.

* Scaling could fail to reduce fees - Adoption can be too fast or Optimism is delayed or not adopted quickly enough by the main gas consumers (Uniswap and Tether).
* POS is delayed - This is ETH we are talking about and this scenario is very likely to happen. POS is scheduled for late 2021 but will more likely come in early 2022
* Transaction fees end up being so low that due to scaling or lack of usage (bear market) - If Ethereum scales too well, fee burns would not have such a big impact on price.

There are also some other issues that are less likely to occur such as a $10 Trillion market cap ETH could cause a regulatory risk as an unregulated decentralized entity being worth so much is a scary prospect for many governments to deal with.

TLDR: ETH is already beating BTC in almost every important metric except market cap, with the EIP-1559 update and upcoming transition to POS ETH will loses 90% of its sell pressure or the equivalent of three BTC halvings in the timespan of 12 months leading to a price explosion that some predict could hit $150,000 by 2023 ([https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bECqgijhgjdS782AB620gFjK5qx-vA99/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bECqgijhgjdS782AB620gFjK5qx-vA99/view?usp=sharing)).

Ethereum,The Ethereum Value Proposition: Dark Horse Edition,"If you’ve been in this sub for years, you may remember a series of posts here dubbed “ethereum value proposition” back in 2021 by yours truly during an epic eth fud campaign before ETH went on its face ripping rally. 

Check the receipts, I did a multi week series in mid march 2021 and days later eth made the face melting gains 3x and up.

Why am I telling you this? To toot my own horn? No. 

It’s because the reason I made those posts years ago was because the market was being HIGHLY irrational toward ETH and I believe it is doing it again, and where irrationality exists, opportunity for gains exists as well.

If you’ve had a pulse in crypto the last 3-6 months you’ll know everyone and their mom has turned bearish on ETH. In 2021 the criticism was “EtH cAnT ScALe”, now it’s “EtH is DeD”

Nonsense. And here’s why:

Tradfi has quickly realized that the megalithic opportunity in crypto is stablecoins (see https://x.com/nic__carter/status/1857408855719674075).

As you can see stablecoin volume has skyrocketed in the last 4 years eclipsing PayPal, bitcoin, remittances, and ALMOST approaching the levels of VISA, the largest payment processor in the world.

Guess where the VAST majority of stablecoin volume happens? Yep Ethereum and it’s L2s. Over 70%.

“Oh but ETH L1 has no usage no one uses it or oh it’s L2s are dead bla bla bla.” 

No, ETH has significantly scaled by introducing “blobs” a few months back. check L2beat, Ethereum and its L2s users and transactions are near all time highs for an aggregate of ~370 TPS currently. Source: https://l2beat.com/scaling/activity

“Oh ok so some people use ETH big deal, but it’s still not a good investment”

If that were true,why then while everyone and their mom has been fudding ETH, Blackrock, (the largest hedge fund in the world)in the last 2 months has increased it’s holdings of ETH in its ETFs by a whopping 65%? Source: https://x.com/EthereanVibin/status/1858254969389863290

Why is over 95% of Blackrocks “BUIDL” fund of over 500 million dollars built on Ethereum?

Why are states like Florida and Michigan starting to acquire ETH? Florida now holds over 800 million in crypto related investments and Michigan 11 million: https://www.ccn.com/news/crypto/michigan-largest-ethereum-etf-holders-us/

“Oh but Bitcoin is the only scarce asset with real value for holders, everything else is just a scam or gambling”

Since proof of stake and the burn was implemented about 3 years ago ETH has had HALF the inflation rate of bitcoin: https://ultrasound.money/

In laymen’s terms, bitcoin is being printed at twice the rate of ETH. People literally do not realize this.
This is beyond significant.

Michael Saylor himself, the bitcoin messiah has said that bitcoin HAS to figure out a way to generate yield, because just holding it long term is not economically feasible, direct quote:

“The point is If the capital doesnt generate a return  its a non performing asset, you need to address the issue. If I put $100B into $BTC and the yield is 0%, thats just as bad as having $100B bonds that pay 0% yield. In both cases theyre non performing""

Source: https://x.com/etheraider/status/1836493170772971646

What this means is that Saylor fully recognizes that yield is KING.

Everyone knows that stocks that provide quality yield command a premium, you don’t think crypto assets will command the same premium anon?

But don’t confuse yield with inflation, yield comes from “activity/MEV/fees”, because if you have high yield due to inflation and not from actual usage of the chain, then your yield will be high but so will the inflation of your coin so you never come out ahead.

And what chain has the purest native premium on yield? The one with the most activity/mev/fees RELATIVE to its inflation, in other words Ethereum.

Saylor for a long time discredited eth because he said it was a security. Now it officially is not.
He now says he wants a “form of bitcoin” aka a scarce asset that gives him yield…..

You do the math.

Saylor may never capitulate and buy ETH due to pride or maybe because he’s built a religious cult following and attack the fragility of bitcoin maximalism by holding another asset but that doesn’t mean you have to repeat his mistake.

Is ETH the BEST asset in crypto? No, there’s no way I can make that claim about any asset without being biased or disingenuous.

Is it ONE of the best risk adjusted reward plays right now given history, tech, present social bias, and network effect?

Absolutely. 

I could go on and on about how ETH has always outperformed BTC in bull cycles, how the weekly RSI is at all time historic lows and therefore represents a legendary buying opp, etc etc

But I’ll end with this:

3 years ago the level of FUD surrounding ETH is what prompted me to post this series because it was so over the top irrational.

The same pattern is repeating now.

If you listened then and did the counter trade congrats. If you didn’t, here’s your second chance

Don’t fall for the CT FUD doomloop.

Don't be fooled into thinking it's better or that Ethereum is ""outdated tech"", Ethereum has the most developers working on improving it by a very wide margin.","I've noticed a lot of people suggesting Ethereum is outdated tech and that BNB is the future because it has lower fees. That couldn't be further from the truth.

BSC is an Ethereum clone and all they did to reduce fees was increase the gas limit. That means that more transactions can be processed for lower fees but it requires more powerful hardware and thus more centralization. Ethereum could do this in 10 minutes if they thought that was beneficial to the network but they haven't because doing so would break a lot of the decentralization and security of the network.

Ethereum is so widely used and trusted **because** it is so decentralized and secure.

Ethereum has the most developers and researchers working on it than any other blockchain project by a very long way which means it is literally the bleeding edge of crypto tech. The Eth killers have a long way to go to knock it off as king of DeFi.

That's not to say that ADA and DOT aren't very promising projects but putting BSC/BNB in with them is almost laughable. It's just a clone! It will always be behind.

There's a popular post on this subreddit that warns of an incoming Ethereum supply shock.

I would just like to point out that the graph is a bit misleading. Yes, the Ethereum reserve in exchanges is dropping, but the post makes it seem far more dramatic than it is.

Here's the link to the graph :

https://cryptoquant.com/overview/eth-exchange-flows/278


The post (intentionally or not) omits the left axis, which clearly shows that the supply on exchanges went from 24M to 18M. 

Without the left axis, it would look like the reserves are dropping to zero, which is far from reality.

I just wanted to point this out for a clearer image.

Ethereum,Why do people think that Cardano is faster than Ethereum?,"OK can we please have a technical discussion regarding the scalability of Cardano? Instead of the regular super highly upvoted moontalk (I know this thread will probably be downvoted to oblivion).

Cardano currently only handles 7 transactions per second on-chain. Ethereum currently handles 12-15 transactions per second on-chain. By tweaking some parameters in the future Cardano could potentially scale to 50 transactions per second on-chain which obviously still isn't enough for real world adoption. Cardano will scale off-chain with layer 2 solutions (Hydra). But they are awfully behind their competition in developing layer 2 support.

Don't take my word for it, even Cardano devs on their own subreddit admit all this.

See here: [https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mxjf0w/psa\_cardano\_ada\_runs\_at\_seven\_7\_transactions\_per/](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mxjf0w/psa_cardano_ada_runs_at_seven_7_transactions_per/)

And here: [https://np.reddit.com/r/Cardano\_ELI5/comments/la7ptu/how\_many\_transactions\_per\_second\_tps\_can\_cardano/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=ios\_app&utm\_name=iossmf](https://np.reddit.com/r/Cardano_ELI5/comments/la7ptu/how_many_transactions_per_second_tps_can_cardano/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

So why do so many people think that Cardano is faster than Ethereum?

Also, I made this same post intended to discuss the scalability of Cardano two days ago. It quickly rose into the top 50 posts until a bot deleted it from the frontpage stating ""there are already 2 posts about this coin in the top 50"". But guess what, there are always 2 non-critical moonboy posts about Cardano in the top 50. So it's very unfortunate that technical discussions about this coin have no place on [r/CryptoCurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/). I will therefore keep posting this daily, until the day a bot doesn't delete it.

Edit: Since this time, this post didn't get deleted, I will add this. I have nothing against Cardano. But I have noted that there currently exists a widespread lack of knowledge regarding the scalability of blockchains in general and Cardano in particular. This is an extremely hard technical problem that haven't been solved for over 10 years. Cardano is not offering a unique quick fix to this anytime in the near future. But I am happy that we now have more projects than ever (including Cardano) that are working on it.",2107,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nonoj6/why_do_people_think_that_cardano_is_faster_than/,1622418540.0

Ethereum,"For the first time in my life I could purchase Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Monero from a crypto ATM here in Geneva (Switzerland). Mass adoption is really starting!","For the time first time ever I used a crypto ATM here in Geneva - although hidden in the manor store, four coins were available for purchase with a 1000 chf limit per person per day. Cash only, you are given a qr code with a public key to send and receive the amount your purchased. The machine was operated by Bity, and for any purchase of Bitcoin I was asked a fee of 4 chf.

This is truly astonishing considering that 10 years ago buying Bitcoin was almost like using limewire. Gradually, I hope to see more ATMs pop up and enable people to invest without having to disclose all your personal information on sites like coinbase or binance.

Mass adoption is really around the corner, and with more and more people jumping on board, I do believe crypto ATM will be a bridge of accessibility. When crypto will become a useable currency in major stores these will become essential!

Edit: Thank you all for taking the time to leave a comment and for the awards and upvotes! 
I must clarify that the reason I made this post was literally because I think it’s useful for all of us to hear, discuss and argue about crypto ATMs and debate on accessibility of crypto to the public and investors, and also to help fellow noobs (like myself) and non-noobs discover something we didn’t know much about until now. I literally found out about this ATM not even two days ago....
Also, how freaking cool is it that you can buy crypto from an ATM?! Come on, that’s just awesome (with pros and cons I hear you).

Ethereum,"Ethereum under governance attack: A selfish group of miners have created EGL token that seeks to artificially control the gas limit, against network’s design. Over 20% of the hashpower has signed up for this already","A token claiming to assist in ethereum governance has been created (EGL token - Ethereum Gas Limit) and around 20% of the hash power of ETH has already signed up for this and are collecting these tokens, which threatens to disrupt the governance process of Ethereum and manipulate gas limit in favour of miners. 

In regular process, the gas limit used on the network is voted on by miners in coordination w/ core devs. The miners can vote on the protocol’s gas limit. In regular course, the miners are incentivised to act in the best interests of the protocol and retain this governance. However, with proof of stake merge cutting miners out, they are now acting in selfish interest. 

However, EGL now seeks to bribe miners to tokenize & sell this control to the market instead, ignoring due process. Such a proposal will never pass EIP process, but now due to greedy miners this attempt at power grab is being played out. 

Miners are taking this step because of the upcoming proof of stake merge, that threatens to cut miners out of the picture. Hence, they are attempting to divest their control on the network in this fashion, by selling their governance out in collaboration with some rogue VC funds, and trying to seek rent on the governance process. 

The Ethereum team must make it clear that they don’t endorse this EGL project. People buying this in the market are just helping rouge miners cash out  and providing liquidity to bad actors.",1483,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p8qoi4/ethereum_under_governance_attack_a_selfish_group/,1629549319.0

Ethereum,"The longer I'm in crypto, the more I lean toward Ethereum Maximalism","In 4 days time the Ropsten test merge will happen, turning the Ropsten testnet from POW to Proof of stake.  On the 30th june, the difficulty bomb will go off, gradually increasing the difficulty for miners to mine blocks.  The data can be found here: 

Http://wenmerge.com

And in an as yet unspecified date in august, the real main net merge will happen.  So why am I so bullish about the merge?  Its largely Eth moving instantly from 3.3% inflation to -0.7% inflation. But it's also these. 

1. 99% reduction in energy cost per Tx. 
2. 90% issuance reduction.  12500 eth a day to 1250. 
3. Miner sell pressure drops from 14,000 eth a day to 0. 
4. More eth locked in the staking contract for 6 months after the merge . 
5. Deflationary asset.  More eth burned than produced if gwei >20gwei.  

Number 3 is I think the most important. While it wont drop to exactly 0 on the first night, removing $30 million of sell pressure per day will have a massive effect.  The market would need to refind this pressure just to stop the price going up. (Its guaranteed profit). It wont find this sell pressure.  

There won't be a 'massive selloff' on merge night.  All eth remains locked into the contract until the next update.  After that, there is a queued release. 

I believe that both Bitcoin and Ethereum are stores of value,  but Ethereum is currently also the worlds largest and most secure crypto network.  It is the foundation of web3.  

As a final note, it took 19 months to get 12.6 million into the deposit contract.   In the last 2 months alone,  2.6 million of that amount was deposited.  

As a final final note, I'd like to thank Do Kwon for causing the luna crash and allowing us to buy Eth this cheap, this close to the merge.  And also removing luna from the market and allowing Ethereum more room to grow in MC.  You're a bastard, make no mistake; but you're a magnificent one.

Ethereum,Is Ethereum Still Worth the Investment? A deeper look.,"&#x200B;

### Ethereum

2021 was a fantastic year for crypto, in particular Ethereum. Ethereum reigns as **the second-largest blockchain** despite the slew of competition from Binance SC, Solana, Avalanche. But it remains far ahead showcased by various metrics, and there are no signs of slowing down.

#### Total Value Locked

[*How to use TVL metrics*](https://medium.com/coinmonks/use-tvl-to-spot-the-next-hot-coin-crypto-market-update-12-28-dbae6020294a)

Ethereum ended 2021 with a Total Value Locked (TVL) of $153 billion and contains nearly 60% of TVL in crypto. Its nearest competitor Terra (LUNA) TVL, sits at $13.3b with 7% of the market. Despite the hype following emerging L1s they remain far from the king.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/blud071uo4f81.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e54dd093d848d7b55536a6f9daa638799116601

 

#### Revenue

Ethereum showcased impressive revenue in 2021 totaling $10.9b. The nearest L1 was BSC, which edged on $1.0b of revenue. There are four projects on Ethereum that post larger revenue than BSC. (Filecoin, Axie, Opensea, Uniswap)

Opensea, an NFT marketplace on Ethereum, saw a revenue of $1.5b in 2021 with the emergence of NFTs.

&#x200B;

#### Layer 2s on Ethereum

Layer 2 protocols are taking traction, benefitting from Ethereum’s **reliability and security**. In the future, Ethereum may be a consensus layer for an extensive array of layer 2s that inherit low gas fees and fast TPS speeds.

Some top names are Polygon (MATIC), Optimism, Arbitrum, Loopring (LRC), and ZkSync.

#### Creator Earnings

Typically, creators on centralized networks like YouTube, Spotify, Etsy, and OnlyFans, only capture a portion of the revenue they create. As the creator economy on Ethereum begins to evolve, many creators will start to see the benefits of capturing a larger percentage of value utilizing a decentralized network. NFTs for artists is a prime example. Ethereum, as a whole, competes with prominent names in creator economies.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bj90vk8xo4f81.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=14b7da6a2f6ce455e71cba02cdddbd46535a31c1

 

#### Eth Burning and Deflationary Pressures

EIP — 1559 upgrade has been burned 1.7 million ETH

at a valuation of $4.6 billion since early Aug 2021. Before EIP-1559, all ETH would remain on the network. Now, supply decreases with every transaction.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p137lguyo4f81.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=177950e27231b4b6e071da3636bd78f1faa1757a

 Even though Ethereum remains inflationary, the increasing demand sees days of negative issuance. With ETH continuously being locked away, bought for speculation, and utilized for gas fees, Ethereum’s deflationary pressures will exceed new supply. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/b9548ab0p4f81.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=33d952ac0f6b1adc67a4015195e051ad01038bfd

&#x200B;

 

#### Conclusion

Ethereum remains far ahead of its competition in almost all metrics. [Moreover, it attracted the highest number of developers in 2021](https://medium.com/coinmonks/electric-capital-developer-report-recap-where-are-the-crypto-developers-going-and-why-its-3855aa5dd1d8) that continue to build the ecosystem.

There are a few negatives for Ethereum, no doubt. Ethereum is slow, and gas fees are incredibly high. In addition, environmental mandates are beginning to add pressure to the “proof of work” consensus. But, Ethereum contains scheduled upgrades that will improve speed, lower gas fees, and see a switch to an eco-friendly “proof of stake.” Ethereum Consensus Network (formerly Eth 2.0) will be near completion in approximately one year.

So, what are we left with?

* The largest and fastest-growing ecosystem in crypto
*  Significant deflationary pressures
* The emergence of Layer 2 options 
*  Dwindling supply
*  Hammered down ETH prices
*  Upcoming improvement upgrades to the network
*  The emergence of creator economy (NFTS, DAOs, music, writers, games)

[It’s no wonder Cathie Wood and her team of quants forecast an ETH price of 180k by 2030](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/cathie-wood%3A-ethereum-will-reach-%2420-trillion-market-cap-by-2030).

2022 will be an important year for [Ethereum upgrades](https://etherworld.co/2021/12/02/ethereums-latest-roadmap/). In the past, upgrades are often delayed and I expect no different this time. But, the process seldom detriments the network. So…

At its current price of $2680, Ethereum could be a complete steal, **and far as the risk/reward ratio, it remains one of the best crypto investments**.

Ethereum,Ethereum Explained for Noobs,"**The Basics of Ethereum (ETH)**

Ethereum’s purpose is to be a decentralized monetary system. It is one of the most versatile cryptocurrencies with many forms of utility, including: smart contracts, defi, and dapps. I will try to explain these things in the most simple way possible. This will be based on Ethereum after its two biggest updates are released in the next 1-2 years. (EIP 1559 and ETH 2.0) Ethereum also goes by ETH and ether. 

**Decentralized Apps (dapps)**

One of Ethereum’s biggest use cases is that it can have tokens built on top of it that can perform a variety of functions and tasks. Some of them can be used to borrow and get loans using cryptocurrency, and some can be used to buy/sell stocks on the blockchain. This is known as decentralized finance (defi). Another use for dapps is decentralized exchanges like Uniswap and 1inch token. These can be used to trade ethereum tokens without a middleman, completely decentralized. These trades require ETH (Ethereum) in order to be finalized. These ETH fees are also known as “gas”. 

**Staking**

With a future update known as ETH 2.0, Ethereum will be moving from mining to staking. Not only does this require far less energy, but it will also allow people to earn interest on their ETH. You use your ETH to help secure the network, and in return you receive the reward of interest on your coins. This interest level will likely be between 5-10%, and will scale up if the price of ETH goes up over time. If you stake 1 ETH, and the interest rate is 10%, you will earn 0.1 ETH no matter what, even if the price were to double. (This interest on your ETH comes from the transaction fees that happen every time someone sends ETH to another address.) 

**Smart Contracts**

Smart contracts are probably the most complicated for some people to understand. But it’s basically telling the ETH network that you want it to perform a task if a certain outcome happens. Here’s an example. Let’s say you are going to bet your friend that a certain coin will double in price by the end of the year. You both lock your ETH up in the network, and all of it is given to the person who was correct. Basically a decentralized middleman.

**EIP 1559**

EIP 1559 is a very important ETH update that is expected to roll out within the next few months. Every time someone sends ETH, there is a network fee. Some of this fee will go to the stakers who earn interest on their ETH to secure the network. EIP 1559 will make it so a part of this fee is completely burned, and will never exist. This will drastically lower the ETH’s inflation rate from about 4.5% to around 0.5-1%. Equivalent to multiple bitcoin halvings.

**Gas**

Ethereum has transaction fees known as ""gas"", this is used to do almost everything on the network. Any time you send ETH, use smart contracts, or use a decentralized app; you will be required to pay some of your ETH. While the fee is considered high by some, it is necessary for the network to remain highly secure. (There are many solutions that will likely lower this transaction fee in the future. It is currently about $20, but is expected to be drastically reduced at some point with ETH 2.0 and EIP 1559. ) This transaction fee or ""gas"" is used to pay the stakers that secure the network, and will be partially burned with EIP 1559.",1655,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mshvtg/ethereum_explained_for_noobs/,1618625282.0
Ethereum,PSA: There is only one Bitcoin and one Ethereum. Beware of coins with similar names. They are not the same thing. They are not equal.,"Considering the ETC and BCH pumps I thought this might be worthwhile to those new to crypto.

Ethereum Classic (ETC) is not the same as the real Ethereum (ETH). They forked a long time ago, which is why they share the name. But nothing is being done on ETC. All those ERC-20 tokens live on ETH, not ETC. Don't be fooled.

Same goes for Bitcoin. There is only one BTC. Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Bitcoin SV (BSV), etc are all forks of Bitcoin. Which means that they tried to make a change to BTC but failed, and ended up with a new coin.

Just like ETH, the real Bitcoin network is the valuable one and that's why there is such a massive difference in price between BTC and the other Bitcoin forks.

TLDR: Don't get fooled by similar names. There is only one BTC, and only one ETH.

Ethereum,Ethereum is an Infinite Canvas for Infinite Ideas,"**TLDR at the bottom.**

I started investing in Ethereum early this year, and the more I understood ETH, the more of a no-brainer it was as an investment. I'll be breaking down ETH for the newcomers, and also for the people already in crypto that hasn't had much opportunity to look into Ethereum, to show you how ETH has the potential to surpass BTC, because of its endless utility. Please be advised, this is just based on what I have learned so far since I started dabbling in the crypto space, if there are any inaccuracies, please feel free to point them out.

**Disclaimer: We are in the middle of a bull market right now, prices may fluctuate so always do your own research before buying. This is not investment advice, merely an explanation of what Ethereum is, and why I decided to invest in it.**

# Utility as a Commodity

On the Ethereum platform, Ether (ETH) is the native token used — meaning ETH is used to process any transaction and changes on the Ethereum blockchain. To power applications and transactions, users and developers use ETH as “gas”, also known as the fee, in order to “fuel” the applications that run on Ethereum. Miners that validate transactions are rewarded through earning the ""gas"" fees.

Gas prices for transactions vary depending on the difficulty of computation. The more complex the transaction, the more expensive it’ll be. For example, sending ETH from one wallet to another is not as much compared to doing a loan on DEX liquidity pools to take advantage of an arbitrage gain. **Since ETH is the network's gas, it has utility rather than just being a pure store of value like Bitcoin.**

As the Ethereum network expands and more developers come into the ecosystem, ETH's demand will increase. The Ethereum network is also constantly breaking ATHs in terms of network traffic and transactions, another sign that utility and demand increase relative to time. Think of it like ETH being oil in the real world. Society needs machinery and vehicles to function, oil powers it, thus, more and more people would want oil in a society where oil is heavily demanded.

# Utility in Applications

Other than functioning as the network's gas, ETH has a lot of purpose in decentralized finance applications (‘dapps’ or ‘DeFi apps’ for short). An example of this is Maker. Maker allows users to use ETH as collateral, allowing you to generate a stablecoin, pegged to the US dollar, called DAI. Other dapps like AAVE or COMP allow users to use DAI or ETH as collateral to take out loans. Users can then put their loans into a ""savings account"", earning a nice APY %. If I were to dive into the Defi use cases of ETH, this post will be super long, so I will keep this part short.

ETH, in short, can be considered a **yield-barring asset**, allowing users to explore a whole new financial world, and gain access to more capital in the decentralized finance world. As of today, over $50 billion is locked in DeFi apps, and this amount is also rising. Developers are also flocking to the network, finding new ways to innovate using the network. This already gives ETH so much upside. **Unlike a lot of current cryptocurrencies out there, where users are simply holding, buying, and selling them, you can use ETH and in very very real ways with tangible benefits.**

[ Total value locked is increasing, relative to time ](https://preview.redd.it/bkrl3llq5kv61.png?width=1180&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1c650a20255c3f9d1258cffbd8d2110b1239bb8)

# Utility as a Base Pair

Back in 2017, a large reason for Bitcoin's boom was because it was the only base pair with other altcoins. This meant that people looking to buy altcoins had to first buy Bitcoin, and then swap it with the altcoins they were buying.

Looking into the DeFi space, we currently have Decentralized Exchanges (DEX for short), like Uniswap and Sushiswap, that use ETH as the main trading pair for ERC20 tokens/altcoins. This means that anyone who wants to purchase new coins and fund projects that are not yet out on centralized exchanges like Coinbase or Binance has to own some ETH before they are able to swap. This gives ETH utility as a base pair and is the ""big boss"" of the DeFi ecosystem.

# Utility as a Store of Value

Ultimately, like any other cryptocurrency, and with the increased exposure cryptocurrencies, in general, are getting, ETH will continue to see a gradual increase in its price. There are upcoming projects to improve ETH, like reducing the gas fees on the network.

People would see Ether as an attractive store-of-value investment in order to capitalize on the potential growth of the Ethereum platform.

Over the past weeks, in the midst of this bull run, we’ve seen ETH ETFs raise [hundreds of millions of dollars of capital](https://decrypt.co/68802/ethereum-etfs-trading-volume-million) — with big institutions and investment firms getting involved. Like Bitcoin, institutional investors and retail investors will want to get involved with an asset that can act as a hedge towards fiat. Long-term investors can also stake their ETH, generating more ETH over time. Pair that with the gradual increase in the price of ETH, the passive income one can generate through ETH is a lot more than with traditional fiat currency.

# Conclusion

To conclude, Ethereum is an asset like no other. **It is money, a commodity, and a yield-bearing asset all in one.** Owning ETH is like owning programmable money, and quite frankly, that is why I invested in ETH. I'm not in it for a quick buck, I just see it as a whole different type of digital asset that I will be involved with over the next decade or two.

**TLDR: Wanted to create a post that newcomers can read and understand more about ETH. ETH has incredible utility as a currency, commodity, base pair, and a store of value.**",1794,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mz3ym1/ethereum_is_an_infinite_canvas_for_infinite_ideas/,1619460563.0

Ethereum,EIP 1559 Officially Launching on Ethereum in July,"EIP 1559 has now been officially confirmed for Eth's July London update.

That means more predictable and lower fees for users, and it will introduce a BURNING mechanism that will burn part of the transaction fees on the network in ETH.

That could very well mean ETH could see serious deflationary pressure (comparable to bitcoin's if not moreso) as early as July.

The increasing growth of DEFI, DAPPS, and transactions on the network coupled with the scarcity introduced through burning could make ETH a comparable or better store of value than Bitcoin.

**To put it in perspective, if EIP-1559 was live yesterday, it would have burned approximately $26M worth of ETH  or roughly 17,000 ETH. Annually that equates to over 6.2 million ETH burned a year at the current rate. That is significantly more than the new ETH being created and would therefore make ETH deflationary**

Essentially, this could mean new ETH created could become more valuable than new Bitcoin created.

Ethereum,[MEGATHREAD] The Ethereum Merge,"## MERGE SUCCESSFUL!!!!!!

Thank you to all the researchers, devs, mods, and supporters. Much love ❤️

## TLDR
Ethereum Mainnet will merge with the Beacon Chain proof-of-stake system, ending of proof-of-work (mining) for Ethereum. [Finematics TLDR video](https://twitter.com/finematics/status/1569311652067135489?s=20&t=3Z5AAWitUca7ArOm62YoVA)


## The Merge!
The Merge represents the joining of the existing execution layer of Ethereum (the Mainnet we use today) with its new proof-of-stake consensus layer, the Beacon Chain. (Formerly called Eth2)

It eliminates the need for energy-intensive mining and instead secures the network using staked ETH. A truly exciting step in realizing the Ethereum vision – more scalability, security, and sustainability. This will reduce Ethereum's energy consumption by ~99.95%.

The Merge is scheduled to happen on block 58,750,000,000,000,000,000,000 (that's a lot of zeros), so the actual date/time is a little bit of a moving target, but there are a few websites to help predict when that will be:

* https://bordel.wtf/
* https://wenmerge.com/

This is the first time a blockchain has swapped its consensus mechanism for another, live, uninterrupted.

## FAQs

* Will this affect transaction fees? Gas fees will not change
* Will there be downtime? Zero downtime
* Will transaction speeds change? Not noticeably

## Do I have to do anything?

If you own any Ethereum, ERC-20s (tokens), or ERC-721s (NFTs):

* Nope, enjoy :)

If you are a validator:

* Make sure your Beacon Chain Client is updated (lighthouse/lodestar/nimbus/prysm/teku)
* Make sure you have a *suggested-fee-recipient* configured
* Make sure your jwt secret is set properly from your execution engine client (geth/nethermind/etc...) in your beacon chain client config
* If you want to sanity check your setup, Somer Esat has great guides: https://someresat.medium.com/

If you a running a node:

* You will need to run a consensus client also, geth guide [here](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interface/consensus-clients) and consensus guides [here](https://someresat.medium.com/)

If you are a miner:

* After the merge, blocks won't be produced by mining anymore, thus no block rewards.
* You will need to run a consensus client (see ""running a node"") if you want to keep running a node.

Ethereum,Vitalik wants to cancel Kim Kardashian for pumping Ethereum Max,"Kim is at it again, making money by pumping a shitcoin called Ethereum Max, as we have seen in one of the top posts, because hopefully nobody here actually follows Kim Kardashian on any social media.

This is actually not the first time she was advertising Ethereum Max, she was doing it already earlier this year, as well as other celebrities, for example Floyd Mayweather. 

Vitalik did react to this in one of his recent talks at EthCC, by jokingly proposing to cancel Kim Kardashian because of it.

Link to the video with timestamp: [Video](https://youtu.be/oLsb7clrXMQ?t=13m13s). 

Later in the same talk during the Q&A, there was a lady who probably is a Kim Kardashian fan, asking a pretty weird question about not canceling Kim Kardashian, but instead tokenizing her closet lol 

Vitalik managed to stay cool and had a good answer, here's a direct link to the question:

Ethereum,Ethereum is undervalued and presents a compelling investment opportunity for the mid-to-long term,"I believe in the current market, ETH is priced irrationally low versus Bitcoin and presents a compelling buying opportunity.  Bitcoin does have the liquidity and volume advantage, but Ethereum will start to gain against it as futures and other financial products (most of which are exclusively Bitcoin right now) start to expand to Ethereum.

If you look at most of the streamlined crypto financial reporting tools, the focus tends to be on Bitcoin and Ethereum- pretty much ignoring anything else.  If you view these entities as a leading indicator for the broader market, they are telling us that *Ethereum is and will remain a major financial asset in the crypto space, very likely to increase in public awareness over time*.  And of course, ETH is one of only two cryptoassets I'm aware of which the SEC has explicitly deemed a non-security (the other is BTC), which gives it important regulatory treatment which will encourage the creation of more US-based financial products based upon it.

This isn't just a first place ""gold"" (BTC) and second place ""silver"" (ETH) comparison though.  ETH is like a ""silver"" which will only continue to get better and more useful over time, while BTC is a digital gold which will remain relatively stagnant and will likely only have as much relevance as the commodity it now seeks to emulate.  *And Ethereum has one advantage Bitcoin will never have- diverse and trust-minimized / trust-less financial and non-financial use cases.*

ETH is not only used as money today in the decentralized Ethereum economy, but Ethereum is used to create, store, and interact with all sorts of financial assets, and much of that activity which would not be possible without it.  *Watch over the next 5 years as Ethereum begins to devour more and more assets onto the chain.  It started with ETH, then ERC-20s, then NFT / digital collectibles, then stable coins, and now onto tokenized securities and even tokenized BTC in the form of WBTC.  As that happens, economic activity on Ethereum will begin to skyrocket, compared to Bitcoin which is effectively a mono-asset market.*

And over a 10 to 20 year timeframe, I'm willing to bet that the asset which actually allows for native decentralized finance (that's ETH) has a decent shot at becoming a broadly accepted money, versus something whose monetary premium is derived essentially from memes only (that's BTC).

*Ethereum is a massive sleeper at #2 with much room to grow, and much world changing potential still to come.*  And right now, it's trading at only 12.5% or 1/8th of the BTC marketcap.  Unless you're one of those people who believe BTC dominance is going to 95% and all other assets will die, this is a very compelling discount for a savvy investor.

Very few other chains provide any meaningful economic value to the space, which is why I believe most financial value will accrue to ETH and BTC over time. That's why I remain about 80% ETH and 20% BTC, and continue to be very optimistic about Ethereum and ETH's future.",1549,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/cf88h3/ethereum_is_undervalued_and_presents_a_compelling/,1563546558.0

Ethereum,Ethereum merge is going to be the game changer we have been waiting for.,"The merge is huge guys. At this point if you are not convinced of what an enormous event this will be for crypto and all of us who believe in the Ethereum project all I can say is be ready to watch this thing take off. It won't be over night although the media will praise this as one of the biggest technological and environmental upgrades seen to date. The fact these guys plan to merge at any given time without stopping the chain is truly amazing. The price may not be indicative of what will happen right away but as Ethereum after merge continues its road map and executes it to perfection you will see more and more people and institutions get on board. There is simply too much money to be made and too many goodies to play with like DEFI, NFT's or ENS domains plus now we are at almost all of us on a layer 2.(if you aren’t here yet WTF are you waiting for?) They keep coming and its not stopping. Once all exchanges participate and on board clients to L2's the game will have changed forever.

In my opinion Ethereum is going to lead the pack of crypto moving forward. I won't talk about flippening or stuff like that because simply who cares. The tech and decentralization speaks for itself. The world's computer is here to stay and not going anywhere. What I am most excited about is that Ethereum is going to take center stage soon and will be finally be acknowledged as a wonderful decentralized technology that welcomes all humans and all institutions to join, build and play. Its the way it should be. All inclusive with no means to discriminate or shun those who don't agree with it. You know who you are!

Ethereum,"“Ethereum is Useless and will Die because of Insanely High Gas Fees!” Is this you? Here is a Guide: How to Move your Ethereum/ERC-20 to Layer 2/Sidechain and do Transactions costing LESS <$0,01 taking 1-2 seconds!","Understandably most people new to this space and Ethereum, are **raging** and fearful with the current gas fees (transaction fees), having sky-rocketed lately. Yes, we are frequently seeing 100 – 300 gwei resulting in **50-150 dollar prices on Ethereum's Mainnet (Layer 1) at rush hour!**

**This post will help you out!**

1. Mainnet: **Why are the gas fees high?**
2. Mainnet: **How can I pay the LEAST POSSIBLE on Ethereum Mainnet?**
3. How solve this problem, by **moving from Ethereum’s Mainnet** to Layer 2’s (L2), Side Chains or Helper Chains that most “veterans” have been using for DeFI and transactions for months. Examples are: **Polygon, Fantom, xDAI, Optimism and soon Arbitrum**. (Polygon and Fantom not being ""true
4.  The **Layer 2 Rollups** will **Scale Ethereum** to new heights 

**REPOST FROM YESTERDAY:** The previous [Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/phcroe/ethereum_is_useless_and_will_die_because_of/) from yesterday and the repost was automatically removed by ModBot. Many msg me to repost, so here it is. Hopefully it stays up!

# 1) Why are the gas fees high?

* Right now, Ethereum can handle about **30 transactions per second (TPS**) at best; Visa, by contrast, does about 1,700 transactions per second and claims it can handle up to 24,000.
* Currently, due to the massive usage (**success/adoption**) of Ethereum being used for DeFI, NTFs mints (crazy shit), transactions by retails, institutions and exchanges the gas fees are rocketing in periods.
* This is bad for us “small fish”, leading to fees higher than some of us have in our wallet! However, this proves that Ethereum still is working securely even under pressure without mistakes. For sure, Ethereum needs to continue to prove that blockchain and smart-contracts are secure and decentralized, in order for adoption, acknowledgment and success of the rest of the crypto space with so **fantastic projects like ADA, ALGO, AVAX, Elrond, Tezos and ONE** etc. can thrive.
* While we wait for ETH 2.0’s Sharding and the current L2 Rollups to take over (see below), we have to look at other tricks and solutions. Besides, I suspect the completion/integration of Sharding to take longer than expected.

# 2) How can I pay the least possible gas on Ethereum Mainnet?

* Use a [Gas Tracker](https://etherscan.io/gastracker) to see the current estimated gas price for a **fast, average or slow transaction,** BEFORE transacting. If you are using e.g. [Metamask](https://metamask.io/), you can **Edit Gas Price** if it is set too high or if you believe it will drop. **Careful:** *If you set it too low*, there is a risk it wont go through, and you got to pay MORE to speed it up.
* In my experience the **gas is LOWEST in the mornings at 6-10 UTC (US night time)**, or especially in **Weekends.**
* If your transaction is not urgent, **WAIT** for the time when it drops back to **GOAL OF 15-35 gwei**! Not many weeks ago it was consistently 7-15 gwei in low traffic hours.

# 3) Make the move from Ethereum Mainnet (Layer 1) to a Layer 2 or Sidechain:

**USEFUL INFO:**

* [Layer 2/Rollups](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/layer-2-rollups/)**:** Is a collective term for solutions designed to help scale Ethereum by handling transactions off the Ethereum Mainnet (Layer 1), while taking advantage of the robust security of Mainnet.
* [Sidechains:](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/sidechains/) A sidechain is a separate blockchain which runs in parallel to Ethereum Mainnet and operates independently.
* **EDIT:** Doing this primarily for those who wanna use DeFi/dApps! No reason to move if you have just wanna HODL your Eth or keep them in a ""earn"" wallet like Celcius, Blockfi, Nexo or crypto . com.
* Moving to the currently most used solution, **Polygon (MATIC),** will for many be like **being born anew** (seriously, [here is my reaction/post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mxrw09/i_just_tried_maticpolygon_l2_for_ethereum_why_did/) 4 months ago). Transactions **cost average $0.0007** and **takes 1-3 seconds** (unless rush hour). Yes, this is already a lot cheaper than almost all L1 competitors.
* Polygon currently already has most big DeFi dApps like **[Opensea](https://support.opensea.io/hc/en-us/articles/1500012889322-How-do-I-purchase-NFTs-on-Polygon-) (free trading of NFTs), Sushiswap, 1inch, AAVE, Curve, Beefy**. And many more are integrating.
* Polygons biggest DEX is [Quickswap](https://quickswap.exchange/#/swap), it's based on Uniswap V2. It has 1 Billion TVL and 24 h volume +/- 100 million. In other words: Great liquidity!
* [Coinbase and other Exchanges are integrating Polygon](https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/coinbase-to-use-polygons-ethereum-scaling-solution-to-reduce-prices-settlement-times-202109010427), so, you soon you can deposit DIRECTLY into e.g. Polygon, and Withdraw directly without having to touch L1's high fee baselayer!
* Another great choice is **Fantom (FTM),** while being it’s own blockchain is compatible with EVM and can be regarded as a helper chain.

**HOW TO:**

* For simplicity, we will focus on Polygon. In order to move to or from Polygon, you need to use this [Bridge](https://wallet.matic.network/bridge/) (there are loads of other bridges too, e.g. between BSC or Fantom).
* I personally connect with [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) (signing all transactions with my hardware wallet [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/)/[Trezor](https://trezor.io/)for security!) or Coinbase wallet to interact with Bridges and dApps. You can easily add different networks ([handy link to do it automatic](https://chainlist.org/)) supporting the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and seamlessly swap between them in your Metamask, after you’ve added them.
* If you use bridge when **we're at 15-25 gwei,** I recon moving e.g. Eth costs like **$3-5 for permission**, then **$7-10 for Transfer.** With current gas prices it's surely >**$**100!

&#x200B;

[Pretty easy to use.](https://preview.redd.it/iijnvxf6uil71.png?width=1917&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b8781401125348fd9808baee844b21b563c6f3f)

1. Chose what and where you want to transfer, and... click transfer.
2. From Ethereum L1 to Polygon, you **first need to pay a 1 time ""permission to use"" transaction** for **each new coin** (it gives permission to the bridge smart contract to use your selected token e.g. Eth, AAVE, LINK). This is cheaper than the actual transfer.
3. When the first transaction is done, you will get prompted to do the **actual Transfer** (higher price). Again, wait until gas fees are low to start the Bride-process, but when it's done you're FREE.
4. Once your crypto arrives at Polygon, **you automatically get some free MATIC that lasts many transactions** (Cant remember, it's 0.01?). You can also use a [faucet](https://matic.supply/) if you run out of gas. I typically just buy 1 MATIC for all my accounts, which will hold for probably 1000 transactions.

# 4) The Layer 2 Rollups will Scale Ethereum to new heights

* Ethereum 2.0 will in the future have it’s **sharding, however I believe the the current working and coming L2/Rollups** will easily scale to >100,000 TPS. Heck even 1 of the current Rollups alone has far better TPS than many of the current L1-competitors!
* There are 3 types of rollups. **ZK-rollups** (Zero Knowledge rollups), **Optimistic rollups** and **Hybrids.**
* **ZK-rollups** bundle or ""roll up"" hundreds of transfers off-chain and generates a cryptographic proof, known as a SNARK (succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge). This is known as a validity proof and is posted on layer 1. Examples of Rollups being built are: **Loopring, Starkware, Matter Labs zkSync, Aztec 2.0, Hermez network** (merged with Polygon), **zkTube**
* **Optimistic rollups** sit in parallel to the main Ethereum chain on layer 2. They can offer improvements in scalability because they don't do any computation by default. Instead, after a transaction they propose the new state to Mainnet, or ""notarise"" the transaction. With Optimistic rollups, transactions are written to the main Ethereum chain as calldata, optimising them further by reducing the gas cost. Examples are: **Optimism** (Live!), **Arbitrum** (Live!)**, Fuel Network, Cartesi and OMGX.**
* In some years **Ethereum will be a beast,** a platform hosting the web3 as a base later, having multiple L2 rollups, sidechains, helper-chains working on top of it, in addition to **Sharding**, making it able to host the necessary thousands or millions of TPS needed for mass adoption.

Complexity is an often overlooked aspect of a system because usually someone else is paying the price for it, not the person creating it.

But don't be mistaken, someone *is* paying the price - whether money, time or mental capacity. They might not be willing/able to do forever.  

As with scalability, complexity also keeps trickling unseen up to the breaking point. At that time, it's already past the point of no return.

Complexity also has the nasty effect of causing cascading failures. Overload people too much, lose capacity, leading to even larger load.  

In #Ethereum's history, complexity never decreased. Every EIP is piling on top. Every major change (1559, merge, sharding, verkle, stateless, L2, etc) is one more nail.

I'm extremely frustrated when a research proposal says ""everything's figured out, it's just engineering now"".  

As good as it feels that we're approaching The Merge, I must emphasize that #Ethereum is not going in a clean direction. Tangentially it's achieving results, but it's also piling complexity like there's no tomorrow.

If the protocol doesn't get slimmer, it's not going to make it.  

I feel the root cause is the disconnect between the research and the dev teams. The former has to ""only"" dream up elegant - standalone - ideas.

The latter needs to juggle every single idea that was ever introduced, whilst surgically expanding the dimensionality of the space.  

There have been engineering attempts to reduce the complexity (module split in Erigon, responsibility split in The Merge). Yet there was never an attempt to reduce the protocol complexity.  

We are already past the point of anyone having a full picture of the system. This is bad.  

I can't say what the solution is, but my 2c is to stop adding features and start culling, even at the expense of breaking things.

There are less and less people knowing and willing to piece together a broken network. And each change pushes more away. /FIN

For BTC, I've used Nasdaq data. For ETH, I've used etherscan's native data. Data was taken from 1st Jan 2023 to 28th Feb 2023.

Note: This analysis **does not** include L2 contributions, as this is not available on etherscan (at least not that I could find).

# ETH surpassed BTC by 460% in number of transactions

That's pretty much the summary on transactions. The totals in transactions so far are:

**BTC: 17,146,792**

**ETH: 61,654,763**

This is expected as there are way more things happening in the ETH chain, such as tokens, digital collectibles etc. An overview of the data is below:

# Sending BTC has been ~3.5x cheaper than sending ETH

The average fees per transaction are:

**BTC: $1.28**

**ETH: $4.47**

I've divided the amount of fees paid in a day by the number of transactions in that day for BTC. ETH's data already comes in averages. Charts are below:

# TL;DR

Since 1st Jan 2023, Bitcoin's blockchain settled 17,146,792 transactions at an average cost of $1.28 per transaction. Ethereum's blockchain (L1) settled 61,654,763 transactions at an average cost of $4.47 per transaction.

Ethereum,A break down of the bull case for Ethereum and how it relates to Bitcoin,"**EDIT 11**: This was just a preliminary write up. You can read the full investment thesis (WIP) [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11oCA9iPtv6s-twhW6PdSpiENKCbeW7aJJO9Jv8KEc2g/edit?usp=sharing).

&#x200B;

There is a general understanding among ETH investors that the enhancements from ETH 2.0, EIP-1559 and L2 solutions will result in a sustainable monetary policy with near 0% issuance and the potential for Ether to become a deflationary asset. What is even more interesting is that the net return of ETH as a SoV becomes superior to BTC the moment that issuance is lower than the staking yield. In other words, even if BTC had already ceased issuance, it offers no mechanism to provide yield to long term holders with a negligible risk exposure as ETH does. There is an execution risk that Ethereum will not deliver on what is currently planned, but if it does then what I have explained will become a reality.

You cannot separate BTC/ETH's payment rails from their respective monetary policies. As you are probably aware, issuance is just a subsidy, and without it the network will need to operate as a profitable business with a cash-flow that is entirely dependent on network fees. We are observing a situation that is causing a degradation of the utility of the Bitcoin network. What I mean by that is that the incentive for users to transact directly on the network is being diminished because of the tokenization into ETH and by the introduction of custodians (like Paypal) and traditional banking services who will soon be entering this space. If these trends continue, I suspect that the only activity that will end-up happening on-chain will be done by whales sporadically transacting to hodle and the occasional settlement from institutions. Bitcoin seems fast and frictionless, but that is because you are comparing it to something in the physical world. In digital terms Bitcoin emulates the friction of operation that is found with gold: it is difficult and expensive to move it, securing it yourself is not trivial, and it does not make for a great medium of exchange. I don't think this will be a good dynamic to generate enough transaction fees. That is of course my subjective interpretation of it, but regarding this particular situation it is nearly impossible to make objective assertions at this point. It is possible to assert that, in the digital world, the expectation of frictionless money would entail near instant transactions with negligible cost and without the relative risk/paranoia of dealing with nuclear waste and having a hacker watching your every move waiting for you to make a mistake to snatch it away. Digital money would also need to interact with other digital assets, preferably defined and operated within the same ecosystem. Ethereum is steaming ahead on all ends.

Ethereum is fostering a digital economy (this is a very important part of understanding the value of Ethereum, but I will not be exploring it in this post) with DeFi at its center. It is currently generating about three times as much trx fee revenue as Bitcoin. L2 solutions are going live as we speak, and it appears that they will be much more practical and provide better UX when compared to the Lightning Network. This will help to amplify L1 block space value and push revenue even higher. That will be followed by EIP-1559, which will burn transaction fees. Mining is currently excessively profitable and the hash rate cannot keep up. This means the financial incentive can be reduced and by burning trx fees we achieve the equivalent of an issuance reduction, while stabilizing mining revenue. Eventually the transition to PoS will dramatically cut the operational cost of the network. That means that Ethereum as a business will become more profitable and less reliant on the issuance subsidy. Finally, we will see the introduction of sharding which will scale L1 by up to 1,000 times, compounding the effect of L2 solutions and making it feasible for the network to operate as a platform for new use cases. A solution to the hacker/nuclear waste security situation is being explored via social recovery wallets. It is still in the early stages of research and design, but it is important to realize that the Ethereum community recognizes it as a problem and is working on a solution.

There is a lot more that can be said about the BTC vs ETH debate and I am working on a full write up that explores each individual element in more detail. Regardless, it is important to pay attention to this trend: the smartest people in this space are shifting their point of view and realizing Ethereum's potential. Raoul Pal is a seasoned investor, extremely bright and open minded. He started with Bitcoin, but it did not take him long to understand the value proposition of Ethereum. Lyn Alden is a brilliant investor and mental powerhouse who initially did not think investing in Ethereum could be justified, but she is also[ starting to shift her view](https://www.lynalden.com/ethereum-analysis) and now understands that it has a justifiable risk/reward ratio to be included in a portfolio (although she is not personally invested in Ethereum). She has plenty of negative things to say about it, however it appears that she recognizes this is not a black and white situation. I have a feeling she will be revising her analysis on Ethereum again in the future with a more optimist view, but maybe that is just wishful thinking.

The crypto space has a few analogies that have been used to describe technical/economic mechanisms that are somewhat tricky to understand: mining, Ethereum's gas, and the analogy between ether and oil. Crypto ""mining"" is not like real world mining. It's purpose is not to extract resources, but it is rather a decentralized mechanism to process transactions. Newly minted BTC tokens are not ""mined"", they are minted by the protocol and awarded to operators. Furthermore, it is impossible to change the total mining output of the network... adding/removing miners does not affect the mining output. If you are new to crypto, you can read a more detailed explanation of mining[ here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/k4qdyc/if_you_are_new_to_crypto_you_may_be_slightly/). ETH's ""gas"" is not like fuel (it cannot even be stored). It is just a computational metric that is more akin to the distance a car must travel, but not what actually makes it move. The fuel is electricity and it must be paid for with ether. When you transact you are also paying for the ""car"" which is the use of all active mining hardware/validators for a fraction of a second. And ether is just money.

If you put too much weight on these simplified analogies, you will not understand the economic actuality behind them. This is a source confusion in the crypto space, and it is used to support false narratives. From an economic perspective, ether is money. Once you understand this, you will know that the narrative that BTC and ETH are not competing because they are different things is analogous to saying fax machines do not compete with the internet.

The beautiful thing about ether is that it is actually not ""just money"". It is a mixture of a scarce monetized commodity, money, bond and tech stock.

* **Monetized Commodity**: Ether is becoming more scarce and will continue to do so with the transition to proof-of-stake and EIP-1559. Ethereum does not have a supply cap, but it does have a roadmap for a sustainable security model and if it achieves a positive cashflow then it will not only eliminate issuance, it can become deflationary.[ An argument can be made about potential issues with Bitcoin's sustainability in the long run.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/k46gge/the_threat_to_bitcoin_that_no_one_is_talking_about/)
* **Currency**: Ether is used as a unit of account and medium of exchange to pay for every activity in Ethereum. It is also used in the same way for venture capital related to ICOs, and Ether is also used as collateral in the DEFI space and new monetary uses will continue to emerge. It is an immature form of money, just like Bitcoin is an immature form of gold. Some people prefer to say that Ether is just a utility token. However, a utility token is just a narrowly scoped form of money. Not only is Ether's scope within its digital economy growing, by next year users will be able to pay millions of merchants with Ether through Paypal. We have never seen the adoption of a new form of money grow organically. New forms of money have always been imposed by authorities. What would the organic growth of money look like? It would look like Ether.
* **Ethereum's digital economy**: Ethereum has limitless use cases and it is already generating economic activity with real world usefulness. Ether's value will benefit from acting as the native monetary asset for Ethereum. As Ethereum's economic activity grows, the velocity and/or value of ether must also increase.
* **Bond**: With proof-of-stake you need to lock up Ether to receive a yield in return. It is similar to how bonds work.
* **Tech Stock**: Ethereum provides a service. That service is paid with ether. The network is controlled by holding ether that is staked. The more valuable the service provided by Ethereum becomes, the more users will be willing to pay for transactions and the more valuable the protocol and the Ether token become. Cloud based services is the entire business model of many companies. The network will be entirely operated by stakers who happen to be the recipients of transaction fees. It is not exactly the same as holding a stock, but there are a lot of parallels.
* **Full reserve banking model**: This is a bit of a stretch, but it is a potential end-game for Ethereum. It can serve as the base infrastructure and reserve asset for a full reserve banking system. In a nutshell: a consortium of banking companies can be formed to standardize a framework to hold and stake Ether under custody in exchange for wrapped Ether. Customers deposit Ether, banks exchange it for wETH and stake the original ETH. Resting balances of wEther on customer accounts can receive a cut of the staking rewards. Banks get their profit model, customers get to spend wrapped Ether with traditional banking services and potentially receive a share of the staking yield. Customers could also have access to a yield curve based on variable reserve requirements. This would allow banks to create money (which is actually good for the economy when it is done with moderation), but for the first time ever customers would have the choice of how much risk exposure they are comfortable with. This dynamic could help to establish a form of democratic check and balances system that discourages moral hazard. Ether could become a godsend to banks in the land of negative yields. It's a pipe dream, but not entirely impossible. Don't forget that the US OCC has essentially given banks the green light to take the first steps in this direction (US banks have been approved to use the Ethereum blockchain for their operations AND they can become validators... yup this happened).

&#x200B;

**EDIT 1: Adding an analogy to explain why ether is money:**

Let’s say I have a car with a 14-gallon fuel tank and I want to take it on a road trip. The car is not aware of the price of gasoline, and it would not travel any farther if the price of gas would double the next day. That’s because the intrinsic utility of oil has nothing to do with its monetary value. The car needs gas because of its particular physical properties and how the ICE is designed to utilize it. If I want to drive from point A to point B and it takes a full tank to get there, it will take that full tank no matter what happens to the monetary properties of gas/oil. This is fundamentally different from how Ethereum uses ether.

Ethereum (the network) is not trying to be money, but it utilizes ether exclusively for its monetary properties and not because it can be magically burned by an imaginary engine of sorts. It costs money to participate in the network as a miner, and their engagement is financially incentivized with ether. Block space is a scarce resource, therefore participants who wish to transact use ether to bid for it. These interactions are utilizing ether as a monetary medium of exchange. In the long run, as the price of ether goes up, the ether denomination of gas prices goes down. That happens because no one is using ether as gas/oil, and it is actually being used as money. In the short run you may see the opposite occurring because of the dynamic between the portion of block space demand that is inelastic and the demand for ether.

**EDIT 2: Revisiting key concepts to explain how they will become price catalysts.**

1. **Wide adoption of L2 solutions**: these will amplify the base layer block space value while encouraging further network adoption by a significant reduction of fees. A successful integration with DeFi protocols will dismiss the ""Ethereum killers"" theory and consolidate market confidence.
2. **EIP-1559**: reduce excessive financial incentives to miners by burning transaction fees. This will also discourage miners from attempting to artificially raise fees via spam.
3. **Sharding**: scale L1 bandwidth, compounding the effect of L2 solutions, further consolidating Ethereum's dominance in the DeFi space, making it feasible to introduce new use cases and eventually increase trx fee revenue.
4. **The switch from PoW to PoS**: discontinuing PoW will eliminate the operating costs related to mining and will allow for a reduction of issuance. Money that was previously allocated to buying mining equipment will be redirected to the acquisition of Ether. Staking Ether will remove it from circulation for extended periods of time. Operating cost will be negligible, allowing validators to withhold most of the Ether revenue. This will be the greatest bull market catalyst in the history of cryptocurrencies and it will eclipse the effect of[ ](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&src=cashtag_click)BTC halvenings.

Bitcoin maximalists will be nay-saying all the way through and past a market cap flip. Do not get caught up in their narrative. If you are not sure, then it is better to rebalance your portfolio proportionally to market caps. If none of these things happen and Ethereum turns out to be a failure, then you would only have reduced your gains by 20%. Otherwise, ETH will be making you mountains of money.

**EDIT 3:** **Ethereum killers**

Ethereum killers remind me a lot of Tesla killers, but a lot worse. People need to understand that cryptocurrency platforms targeting financial Dapps are fighting the equivalent force of a black-hole when it comes to Ethereum’s network effect and user retention in this space.

Bigger players, with bigger money, are entering this market and they will not settle for anything other than the top dog. This pattern reinforces Ethereum's position as the premium financial system, which ends up attracting even bigger players and resulting in the black-hole effect. To make matters even more complicated, financial apps are more valuable when they are surrounded by a rich and diverse variety of digital assets and other natively defined Dapps. There is not much you can do with your money in a ghost town.

It is VERY difficult to build this type of environment up because the platform and dapps must also have established full trust from their user base. This is not to say there is no space for other networks to grow, but just don’t get your hopes high that they will be taking Ethereum’s stronghold as a financial system. There are other use cases that do not require the amount of decentralization and security offered by Ethereum, and the networks that can focus on these are the ones who will be able to coexist with in the long-run. Gaming, ERP interoperability and supply chain are good examples of such use cases. Remember that alternatives with cheap transactions have existed for a while and they have barely touched ETH's dominance (EOS, NEO, VET, QTUM, IOTA, LSK, STRAT, ARK and dare I say... TRON).

**EDIT 4: Refuting critiques about dynamic monetary policy**

If an argument can be made that the financial incentives to operators (miners/stakers) are excessive or insufficient then an argument can be for the implementation and execution of a dynamic monetary policy.

I don't think an arbitrarily picked issuance schedule determined during the genesis of a new highly complex system is likely to be efficient through its lifecycle. Bitcoin's monetary policy provides the certainty of stability and protection from abuse, but it sacrifices the possibility of efficiency and jeopardizes longevity. It would be like if a captain of a ship would point it in the direction of its final destination, set the throttle, then fall back to his cabin for a nice bottle of chianti and hope that the ship would arrive safely. There would be no one at the helm to navigate the seas, no one to make sure it stayed on route, no one to avoid the storms or to take advantage of currents. In my opinion it is a pretty bad approach to something as critical as monetary policy.

With respect to Ethereum's dynamic monetary policy: I don't see any evidence to suggest developers have been enriching their pockets by keeping issuance at the levels they are. Developers are stakeholders and the Ethereum fund holds a lot of ether - debasing ether is against their self interest. There is a great misunderstanding that the one's who are adjusting issuance are the recipients of the new tokens. Is there any documented case of this happening?

**EDIT 5: Addressing Bitcoin's immutable monetary policy**

The idea that Bitcoin's monetary policy cannot be changed is a myth. It is a false narrative that takes for granted that the issuance subsidy will no longer be necessary at some point, but there is no way to objectively assert this. There is no divine power preventing the monetary policy from being changed. If the security model for Bitcoin was jeopardized because of insufficient cash flow to miners, then Bitcoin's monetary policy would be the first thing on the chop board to go in order to remedy the situation.

**EDIT 6:** Five years ago naysayers were screaming about how everything that is being done TODAY in the Ethereum network would never work. Now they are calling Ethereum a scam, or that is is a platform for degenerate gamblers, or that the fees are too high and therefore it is useless, or that it can't scale, or that something else better is just around the corner to take its place.... you know... basically all the things that traditional bankers have to say about Bitcoin, maxis are saying about Ethereum.

**EDIT 7:** The greater the impact a new technology can have on society, the more difficult it is to comprehend its potential. Ethereum has the potential to have a dramatic impact on human civilization. It could take decades for it to be fully realized, but it would change the world in ways that we cannot possibly imagine today. If it happens, the moon will be just a pit-stop.

**EDIT 8:** Thank you so much for all the awards! Ethereans understand this stuff, and I could feel the frustration in the air every time someone said that Ethereum is not money, or that ETH and BTC are completely different things, or all the other bs attacks that are in great part founded on a lack of understanding of how BTC and ETH actually work. I would love to hear what guys like Raoul Pal, Pomp, Michael Saylor and Fernando Ulrich (for my Brazilian friends) would have to say about some of the things that have been written here. If you know a way to get their attention, then please do it.

**EDIT 9**: Clarification about Lyn Alden's opinion of Ethereum

**EDIT 10:** I am still working on a much more ambitious write up. It is focused on economic aspects of money, monetary systems and global asset markets. I still have not incorporated any of the information written here, but I eventually will merge it together. One of the main new ideas that I am exploring is challenging the notion that money has no intrinsic value and that scarcity is the most important attribute of money. I think I make a compelling argument to demonstrate that facilitating economic activity is more important, and how Ethereum has a big edge over Bitcoin in this regard.

Anyways I saw his profile mentioned on a another post and it really took me by surprise and just wanted to share it as I found it super cool.

Ethereum,"Former CEO of MicroStrategy, Michael Saylor, believes that the SEC will classify Ethereum as a security this summer and reject the corresponding applications for spot ETFs. In his opinion, only BTC has full institutional recognition, calling it the “only universal” institutional-level crypto asset","He believes that other cryptocurrencies will also receive unregistered status, including BNB, Solana, XRP, and Cardano.

*“None of them will be wrapped by a spot ETF, none of them will ever be accepted by Wall Street…”* he says.

Saylor’s remarks came as many experts expressed concerns about whether the SEC will approve the listing and trading of spot Ether ETFs on U.S. exchanges. The first significant deadlines for ETF applications from VanEck and ARK Invest will be May 23 and May 24, respectively.

Ethereum,For Crypto noobs - Why ethereum is a really big deal,"I was discussing this topic with someone new to crypto and thought I'd make it into its own post, hopefully it is useful to anyone starting out in the crypto space and provide some clarity in (relatively) plain english on how ethereum really is changing finance as we know it.

ETH has enabled a few totally new things that really are revolutionary to the crypto space including:

1.	‘stablecoins’, or more generally 'tokenized assets', cryptocurrencies whose value is pegged to the value of another asset, like the US dollar. (eg USDT/Tether, USDC, Dai) This allows crypto users to easily exchange their more volatile assets such as ethereum or any other ‘ERC-20’ token (basically a token created using ethereum and exists on the ethereum blockchain), into one that reliably maintains its value, while still having all the advantages of having a blockchain asset (eg secure, global, permissionless transactions).
2.	Decentralized, smart contract-based trading platforms, allowing users to trade while still maintaining full self-custody of their private keys unlike on centralized cryptocurrency exchanges. In other words you always maintain control of your coins, instead of needing to send your coins to the exchange to trade them. On top of that they never have any downtime during volatile markets like centralized exchanges. They also can't stop you from trading \*cough cough\* ^(robinhood)
3.	The development of decentralized, peer-to-peer lending/borrowing platforms. This allows users to earn interest on their cryptos or borrow cryptos. These loans are quite low risk due to them being overcollateralized loans, meaning that to take out a loan, you must post collateral, in the form of other crytpocurrencies that is more valuable than what you are borrowing. This means that people can invest in crypto in a low risk way, lending out stablecoins can yield >5% annual returns which, while much lower than what is possible with higher risk crypto investments, is still quite high given the risk profile, easily 10x the annual return of a savings account at a bank.

These three things constitute a large part of what we call ‘decentralized finance’ or DeFi and right now they only really exist on the ethereum blockchain. Right now there is one major problem for both bitcoin and ethereum, scalability. Essentially, transaction fees are obsurdly high making it cost-prohibitive for most people to take advantage of these amazing new features. The good thing is, over the course of the next 1-2 years (potentially even in the coming weeks), we will be seeing the implementation of several major solutions to this for ethereum. Namely 'Layer 2' (L2) solutions (aka off-chain solutions),  these allow users to make ethereum based transactions off the ethereum blockchain and onto a platform that can handle more transactions. The other solution to the scaling problem is ethereum 2.0. This is an improvement to the ethereum platform itself, making on-chain (as opposed to off-chain, L2) transactions much more effecient. With these solutions in place, we could be seeing transaction fees at <$0.01 and transaction speeds in <1 second. Unfortunately, at least in my view, we don't have the level of concrete development in this area of bitcoin, making the prospect of bitcoin scaling less likely to be coming soon.

So as you can see, the future for ethereum is very exciting, and the things I mentioned really just scratch the surface in what is possible with ethereum. Hopefully, I have provided some of the DOGE noobs who just got burned with some knowledge on what really is so interesting about crypto - its not all just a pump and dump meme like doge, this stuff is real.",1232,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lb4t9h/for_crypto_noobs_why_ethereum_is_a_really_big_deal/,1612295867.0

Ethereum,Ethereum outperformed Bitcoin by 338% in number of transactions during 2022,"It seems ETH is putting up a fight, after all! When comparing charts of their performances the difference is clear:

[ETH and BTC transactions during 2022. Data was fetched from Nasdaq and Ychart.](https://preview.redd.it/kle2j5intn9a1.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=bdd2f89d6ed3c1162f409816c8e51d83a9559df6)

The values shown in the chart are in millions of transactions. The average transactions per day were 1,119,292 for ETH and 255,086 for BTC.

Another thing to point out is that BTC transactions followed a clear periodic pattern. I was not expecting that either. ETH, on the other hand, had more volatility to this matter. **This is expected as there are NFTs and all kinds of smart contracts going on there**.

# The total numbers were:

* 408,541,610 ETH transactions
* 93,106,378  BTC transactions

I guess ETH is indeed more bound to adoption due to the amount of use-cases it already has. Before getting the data I was expecting that this would be the scenario, but 338% is way more than I thought.

I was skeptical about people saying that a flippening could happen some day, but now I see that people advocating for it do have some basis to say so.

Ethereum,Crypto gets an unexpected Super Bowl appearance as Charles Hoskins has a 30 second chat with why Cardano is superior to Ethereum,"With the SEC focused on Staking as a Service and Ethereum getting focused as having an unaffordable minimum staking requirement for retail - in hindsight it seemed inevitable that Charles Hoskinson would find a way to try and get people focused on Cardano. To everyones surprise (are we really surprised?) Charles Hoskinson had a 30 second appearance during half time commercials in what can only be described as one of his normal Youtube videos -  while he tossed a football in the air and talked about why Cardano is superior to Ethereum.

Transcript from Commercial

>America as you drink your beer and celebrate this wonderful and highly competitive superbowl. We need to talk about the Elephant in the room. While the SEC attacks staking and Ethereum - you must know that Cardano that's C-A-R-D-A-N-O, is not like Ethereum. Unlike Ethereum requiring nearly $50K you can stake Cardano with under $1. Cardano even allows you to maintain full control of your crypto in your wallet while staking, unlike Ethereum forcing you to lock it up for unknown amounts of time. While the SEC attacks staking as a service it's important for everyone to remember, unlike Ethereum, Cardano is highly competitive and the best choice for your Staking needs.  Thank you America, may the best team win.

Happy 8th Birthday to Ethereum!

The Ethereum genesis block was created exactly 8 years ago today, on July 30, 2015, at exactly 10:26 a.m. EST. Ethereum was born.

Without a doubt this marked the start of what is known today as DEFI decentralized finance. ETH grew to become the second largest cryptocurrency by marketcap and has been holding that position for several years now. 

There have been numerous projects claiming to be the ETH killer, all of which have failed. Ethereum is here to stay and here to co exist with its competition.

Ethereum,"Ethereum is now consuming 99.99% less energy through The Merger for Proof of Stake, and its not even been a half a year since then.","If we would go back exactly one year, one of or maybe even the most anticipated Crypto events was The Merger, the event where Ethereum would finally transact from Proof of Work to the Proof of Stake mechanism. After years of waiting and delays we had it happy, right in the middle of the bear market on 15th September of 2022, a historic date nonetheless.

Now just about 5 months later we can already have a look at the effects of this Merger, one of the biggest that also shuts down most Crypto haters is that Ethereum is now consuming 99.99% less energy than before The Merger.

&#x200B;

[Chart from the official CCRI site](https://preview.redd.it/nfo1qr09zrka1.jpg?width=1765&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3fffa658740ca0a9edad40caf9a0d45b24d94f48)

Here we can see the chart from a report by the CCRI, the Crypto Carbon Ratings institute.The electricity consumption has fallen from 23 million megawatt hours per year to now just 2.6k megawatt hours per year. Also the CO2 emissions have fallen from 11 million to 870, a near 99.99% drop too.

That is a very good illustration of the changes too from pre-Merger to now post-Merger Ethereum.

It surely has been a good development but we should also not come up and say tat Bitcoin should do that too because PoW is what makes Bitcoin to Bitcoin, we also should not care about the critics of Bitcoin here as they will find another argument if not the energy consumption of Bitcoin.
